# Portfolio 2021

This time around I designed my portfolio using a template from Gatsby.js. I wanted to try a new tool instead of re-designing my [dated portfolio](https://github.com/victorzottmann/portfolio-2020) from 2020. 

The license below attributes the usage of the template to its respective designer.
